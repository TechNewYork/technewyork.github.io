<h1 id="history">History</h1>
<p>The history of call centers dates back to the early days of the telephone, with the term &ldquo;call center&rdquo; emerging around 1983.
However, the foundational service of handling calls can be traced to the invention of the telephone in 1876. The development of call centers evolved significantly with the introduction of various technologies. Early on, solutions like the switchboard, which appeared in 1882, facilitated the management of multiple calls simultaneously. By the 1960s, major telephone companies utilized operators to handle customer inquiries, marking the beginning of what we now recognize as the call center industry.</p>
<p>During the 1970s and 1980s, technological advancements allowed businesses to adopt call center models as essential sales tools. The popularization of “1-800” numbers became a hallmark of this era, establishing the foundation for what would soon become a critical component of customer service strategies.</p>
<p>As the industry grew, call centers focused on maximizing efficiency in handling a high volume of calls, often relying on scripted responses and manual processes, which sometimes resulted in suboptimal customer experiences.</p>
<p>The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) marks a significant turning point in the evolution of call centers. With the rise of AI technologies, the focus shifted from merely managing calls to enhancing the customer experience through personalized service and real-time problem-solving capabilities.</p>
<p>AI-driven tools began to automate repetitive tasks and provide support to agents, which significantly reduced wait times and improved response accuracy.</p>
<p>One of the latest developments in this field is the emergence of Agentic AI, a form of AI characterized by its autonomy and decision-making capabilities. Unlike traditional AI systems that operate within fixed rules, Agentic AI can adapt to changing environments and solve complex, multi-step problems independently.</p>
